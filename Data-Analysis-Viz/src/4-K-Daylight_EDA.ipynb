    "## Normalize daylight data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Method: Z-score\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to make the 'daylight' variable more amenable to statistical analysis, we first attempt to normalize its values by finding the standard deviation of each measurement from the mean value.  This transformation will be useful when we want to look for correlation between daylight hours and other variables.  Instead of measuring covariance, we can use normalized data to look for a correlation coefficient on the range [-1, 1].  Unlike with covariance measure, which is based on raw values has an unlimited range, the standard range of the correlation coefficient helps us understand the _degree_ to which data may be viewed as correlated.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Note that we are using our 'daylight' measurement as a rough estimate for the relative amount of daylight that each individual in our primary dataset had available to them during the winter season in 2022.  We only obtained a single daylight measure on the Winter Solstice for each state, based on the geographic location its capital.  The actual daylight available to each individual will vary depending on their specific geographic location.  In some cases, such as for the state of California, which spans from 42 degrees latitude in the north to nearly 32 degrees latitude in the south, the daylight window range is significant (for California, the difference is ~9 hours at the northern border vs. ~10 hours at the southern border).  Given that we do not know the detailed geographic distirbution of the population sampled in the BRFSS for each state, it is not possible to provide a considerably more accurate measure of the amount of daylight each individual in the BRFSS had available._\n",
    "\n",
    "_It is also a gross approximation to choose a single day of the year (the Winter Solstice) as a proxy for the amount of daylight an individual had available during the entire winter season.  However, the Winter Solstice does mark the extreme in difference between latitudes for daylight hours.  We could have taken a total of daylight hours available each day across a defined \"winter season\" of ~3 months centered around the Winter Solstice, but this would simply have had the effect of dampening the difference between latitudes._\n",
    "\n",
    "_Finally, the amount of daylight each individual actually received will vary depending on their living situation (large windows in the house?), routines (how much time do they spend outside?), and other factors that we could not measure._"

    "One aspect of the Z-score that may not be desirable is that it transforms the raw data's native distance measure into the standard deviation of the data.  When the data we are dealing with is a random sample, this may be desirable as it dampens the effect of outliers.  However, in our case, we know that Alaska and Puertro Rico are not ouliers.  More importantly, the amount of daylight a person has available each day already has a native distance measure that we may want to preserve: time.  Using a min-max scaler rather than a Z-score does a better job of preserving this native distance measure."

When then calculated a Z-score for both 'Daylight Hours' and the 'Depression Index' (DI) in the merged dataframe.
