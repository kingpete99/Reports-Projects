This folder contains samples of the datasets used for the project.

The primary dataset is the 2022 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System ([BRFSS](https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/index.html)), publicly available from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC).

Our team also used an [API service from the U.S. Naval Observatory](https://aa.usno.navy.mil/data/api) to obtain sunrise/sunset times for various locations in the United States in 2022.

We merged these two datasets to create a novel dataset that allowed us to analyze for the effects of available daylight hours on behavioral health (specifically, for risk of depression).

Unfortunately, we found no real correlation, but we reported the results with academic integrity.
