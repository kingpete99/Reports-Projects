In the scenario for this project, company leadership is trying to understand what is driving an increase in employee turnover.  The analysis uses logistic regression to identify the leading drivers among a variety of possible factors.  The response variable -- whether the employee decides to leave or stay with the company -- is modeled as a binary (Bernoulli) random variable.  The analysis was based on synthetic data provided as part of the course.
